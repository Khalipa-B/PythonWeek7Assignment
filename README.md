# Iris Dataset Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to load, analyze, and visualize the classic **Iris dataset** using Python. The notebook is structured as a simple data analysis assignment, making it ideal for beginners learning data science, pandas, and matplotlib.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and statistics, consisting of 150 samples of iris flowers classified into three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

Each sample includes 4 features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## Objectives

- Load and explore the dataset using `pandas`
- Perform basic data analysis and statistics
- Create visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Handle missing data and basic error checking

## Visualizations Included

- ðŸ“ˆ Line Chart: Sepal length trend over index
- ðŸ“Š Bar Chart: Average petal length per species
- ðŸ“‰ Histogram: Distribution of sepal width
- ðŸ”µ Scatter Plot: Sepal length vs. petal length by species

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (to load the Iris dataset)
